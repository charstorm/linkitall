# linkitall
‚ùóThe project is still in beta phase. Expect breaking changes to graph definitions in future.

Linkitall is a tool to create a dependency graph of ideas.
The generated graph gives a strict level-based graphical structure to knowledge.
Linkitall takes a graph definition file in YAML format and generates an HTML file
containing nodes and connections between them.
This makes Linkitall a powerful tool to build teaching materials as well as
reference materials.

This tool is part of the **graphitout** project.

this tool in action.

Our motto is **untangle, refactor, rename**
