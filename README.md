# linkitall

With Linkitall, we can create a visual map of how ideas are related to each other. The map shows the hierarchy and connections of different concepts in a clear and organized way in the form of a dependency graph. We just need to write a YAML file that defines the graph structure and Linkitall will generate an HTML file with interactive nodes and links. Linkitall is a great tool for creating educational and reference materials that show the big picture of any topic.

An example: [Trigonometric Relations](https://charstorm.github.io/class-11-12-india/class11/maths/trigonometry/relations/)

## Usage

Download the latest release zipfile and follow the instructions in the README.md inside.

If the release files fail due to some reason, please build the tool from the source as explained below.

## Build

The steps for building the tool from the source is given here.

Clone the source files locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charstorm/linkitall.git
```

The source files are located in `linkitall/src` directory. The project is written in Golang and is tested on version `go1.20.7`.

CD to the `src` directory, build the tool, and check the result:

```bash
cd linkitall/src
go build
./linkitall --help
```

To make the tool available globally, it is required to add the directory path to PATH environment variable.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/linkitall/src/"
```

## Graph Generation

The tool takes the path to a directory containing the graph file `graph.yaml` and it's dependent resources as the input. See `examples/simple` for a quick reference. More details about the graph file is explained in the section "Graph File",

To run the graph generation, execute the following command (assuming `targetdir` as the directory of graph file and its resources):

```bash
linkitall -i targetdir
```

If executed successfully, it will generate  an `index.html` file at `targetdir`. Additionally, asset files (CSS, JS, etc) required for the generated HTML will be copied to the `targetdir` with name `linkitall_assets`. These are initially located in the same directory of the `linkitall` tool. However, it is a one-time action. Subsequent invocation of the tool will skip this copy-assets step. Same is true for the vendor files (3rd party libraries) used by the project. They are stored in `linkitall_vendor` directory.

One can open the generated HTML file in a browser and see the result.

### CLI

```
Usage: linkitall [--serve] [--release] [--listen LISTEN] --indir INDIR [--graph GRAPH] [--out OUT] [--overwrite]

Options:
  --serve, -s            run in edit-update-serve mode
  --release, -r          run in release mode
  --listen LISTEN, -l LISTEN
                         listen address in serve mode [default: :8101]
  --indir INDIR, -i INDIR
                         path to the input directory
  --graph GRAPH, -g GRAPH
                         input graph base filename [default: graph.yaml]
  --out OUT, -o OUT      output html base filename [default: index.html]
  --overwrite            overwrite asset files
  --help, -h             display this help and exit
```

1. `serve` - to run in server mode. See below.
2. `release` - run in release mode. This includes:
    - use CDN for links, instead of local vendor files.
3. `listen` - the address to listen to (eg: ":8101") in the server mode.
4. `indir` - input (or target) directory containing the graph file.
5. `graph` - base-name of the graph file (eg: "main.yaml") inside `indir`.
6. `out` - base-name of the output file to be created inside `indir`.


### Server Mode

The default behavior of the tool is to run the generation process only once. This is not ideal for development. For that, we have added a server mode, which can be enabled by the -s flag.

```bash
linkitall -s -i targetdir
```

This will start an HTTP development server at default port 8101. One can see the results by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8101 . 

The tool will wait for user input to update the generated graph. Enter will trigger a graph generation, q will quit the tool.

With this development process for the graph will be as follows:

1. Make changes to graph file

2. Press Enter to trigger a graph generation
   
   1. If there are errors, fix them and continue

3. Refresh the webpage to see the updated graph

## Graph File

To be filled later.

For now see `examples/simple` for reference.

## External Examples

We are currently building graphs for topics covered in class 11 and 12 (plus-one and plus-two).
You will find the example graphs in this repository:
[class-11-12-india](https://github.com/charstorm/class-11-12-india) (See readme.md).
